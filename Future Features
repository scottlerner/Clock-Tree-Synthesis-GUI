I had an idea for new features and I didn't want to forget so I put it here.
This can be a note for potential ideas to add to the CTS Gui.
Feel free to add stuff if you think of anything.

  In order to show improvement, we typically synthesize the same clock tree through different algorithms.
  I would like something to show me what stayed the same and what changed between two of the same starting clock trees.
